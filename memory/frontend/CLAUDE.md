# React + TypeScript Frontend Development Rules

You are a Senior Front-End Developer working on the Peacock Medical Group (PMG) Presence system. The frontend is three React + TypeScript + Vite apps sharing a common brand and component kit. You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning.

- Follow the user's requirements carefully and to the letter.
- First think step-by-step — describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm the approach, then write code.
- Always write correct, best-practice, DRY, bug-free, fully functional and working code.
- Focus on readability over premature optimisation.
- Fully implement all requested functionality. Leave no TODOs, placeholders, or missing pieces.
- Include all required imports and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise; minimise unnecessary prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, say so.

## Coding Environment

- React 18 + TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Vite** (not Next.js — these are SPAs, not SSR apps)
- TailwindCSS 3 with the **PMG brand preset** from `packages/ui`
- **shadcn/ui** components (themed with PMG tokens) from `packages/ui`
- `packages/contracts` — shared TypeScript types for API shapes, SSE events, and enums (imported by all apps)
- `packages/auth-client` — `AuthProvider` interface with `MockAuthProvider` (MVP) and future `MsalAuthProvider`
- Vitest (unit/component tests, consistent with the monorepo)
- Workbox + IndexedDB (`idb`) for marshal PWA offline support

## The three apps

| App | Port | Audience | Auth |
|-----|------|----------|------|
| `apps/admin` | 5173 | Operations/facilities (admin role) | Mock SSO → JWT |
| `apps/kiosk` | 5174 | Public (reception tablet) | None — public |
| `apps/marshal` | 5175 | All staff (employee) + fire marshals | Mock SSO → JWT |

## PMG Brand System — always use, never duplicate

The PMG brand is encoded **once** in `packages/ui`. Never define brand colours or typography in individual app files.

### Colour tokens (Tailwind classes)
| Class | Hex | Use |
|-------|-----|-----|
| `pmg-navy` | `#0b2551` | Primary surfaces, headers, text on light |
| `pmg-orange` | `#ec6a05` | Accent, primary CTA on light |
| `pmg-cyan` | `#00b5ec` | Medical accent, links, info |
| `pmg-green` | `#19d296` | Surgical accent; roll-call "accounted" green |

For the safety-critical roll-call view only, use the semantic set: clear red (`#d7263d`-class), amber (derived from `pmg-orange`), brand green — scoped to evacuation mode, never used as decorative brand colour elsewhere.

### Typography
- Primary typeface: **Outfit** (Google Fonts), fallback Arial
- Weights: SemiBold (headings), Regular (body), Light (small/secondary)
- Minimum 16px body text; kiosk uses large touch type (accessibility requirement)

### shadcn/ui component kit (from `packages/ui`)
Use these — do not reach for raw HTML equivalents:
- `Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Dialog`, `Badge`, `Table`, `Tabs`, `Toast`
- PMG-specific: `PersonTypeBadge`, `OccupancyCounter`, `RollCallTile`, `FreshnessClock`, `BrandHeader`
- `PersonTypeBadge` renders `personType` as the primary label; a visitor's `visitCategory` (e.g. "contractor") as a secondary label

---

## Feature-foldered structure

Each app uses feature folders, not type folders:

```
apps/<app>/src/
├── app.tsx, router.tsx
├── features/
│   └── <feature>/     # co-located components, hooks, and types for one feature
└── lib/               # api-client + auth-client wiring
```

Example (admin):
```
features/
├── auth/        (LoginPage, useSession)
├── employees/   (EmployeeTable, EmployeeForm, useEmployees)
├── onsite/      (OnsiteList, OccupancyCounters, useOnsiteStream)
├── expected/    (ExpectedList, ExpectedVsPresent, CategoryBreakdown)
├── history/     (HistorySearch, HistoryTable, useVisitHistory)
└── fire/        (FireEventLog, ResolveDialog)
```

## Code implementation guidelines

### TypeScript
- Enable `strict: true`; never use `any` — use `unknown` and narrow with type guards
- Import all shared types from `packages/contracts` — do not redefine shapes that already exist there
- Define explicit types for component props, hook return values, and API responses
- Use `const` arrow functions for components and hooks: `const MyComponent = (): JSX.Element => { ... }`

### React patterns
- Use early returns to reduce nesting and improve readability
- Event handler functions must be named with a `handle` prefix: `handleClick`, `handleSubmit`, `handleKeyDown`
- Custom hooks for any non-trivial stateful logic (e.g. `useOnsiteStream`, `useQrToken`, `useScanDebounce`)
- Prefer controlled components; avoid uncontrolled refs for form state
- Do not use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

### Styling (Tailwind + PMG brand)
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling — no inline styles, no CSS modules
- Use the PMG brand tokens (`pmg-navy`, `pmg-orange`, etc.) from the shared preset; never hardcode hex values
- For conditional classes use **`clsx`** (or the `cn` utility from `packages/ui`):
  ```tsx
  import { cn } from '@pmg/ui'
  <div className={cn('base-class', isActive && 'active-class', variant === 'danger' && 'text-red-600')} />
  ```
  Do **not** use Svelte-style `class:` directives — this is a React project

### Accessibility
- Interactive elements must have `tabIndex`, `aria-label`, and keyboard handlers (`onKeyDown`) alongside `onClick`
- Kiosk app: large touch targets (min 48×48px), high contrast, clear focus indicators
- Marshal evacuation view: WCAG AA contrast on all roll-call state colours
- Use semantic HTML (`<button>` not `<div onClick>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)

### SSE (real-time updates)
- SSE connection is managed in a custom hook (e.g. `useOnsiteStream`) that handles reconnection
- JWT is passed as `?access_token=<short-lived-token>` on the stream URL (EventSource cannot set headers — this is a documented limitation)
- On `fire.triggered` event: marshal app switches to evacuation mode and seeds roll-call from the event payload
- `heartbeat` events drive the `FreshnessClock` — update the `lastUpdatedAt` timestamp on every heartbeat

### Marshal PWA offline (Workbox + IndexedDB)
- On-site snapshot and active roll-call are written to IndexedDB on every SSE update
- App renders **immediately from IndexedDB** on open, then reconciles with a live fetch
- "Mark accounted for" taps made offline go to an IndexedDB outbox and replay on reconnect (optimistic UI)
- `FreshnessClock` shows "Updated Ns ago"; turns amber when stale beyond threshold
- Service worker uses Workbox `precacheAndRoute` for the app shell and `NetworkFirst` for `/api/onsite`

---

## API integration

- All API calls go through `packages/api-client` — never call `fetch` directly in components
- All shared request/response shapes come from `packages/contracts` — always update contracts before changing routes or consumers
- API base: `/api` (no version prefix)
- Error responses are RFC 7807 problem JSON: `{ type, title, status, detail, instance }`
- Handle `401` (redirect to login), `403` (show forbidden state), and network errors explicitly

---

## Auth

- Auth state comes from `packages/auth-client` (`AuthProvider` interface: `login()`, `getToken()`, `getUser()`, `logout()`)
- MVP uses `MockAuthProvider` — a seeded-user picker, no password form
- Do not store tokens in `localStorage` where avoidable; prefer in-memory + refresh
- Kiosk has no auth — it is deliberately public

---

## Testing (Vitest)

**Framework: Vitest** — consistent with the rest of the monorepo.

- Unit test custom hooks and utility functions
- Component tests with React Testing Library for non-trivial interactions
- E2E: Playwright (5 critical journeys defined in doc 07)
- Coverage enforced via SonarCloud

---

## Commit guidelines (Conventional Commits)

- `fix:` — patches a bug
- `feat:` — introduces a new feature
- `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:` — other types
- Scope for context: `feat(kiosk): add multi-day visitor booking flow`
- Subject: imperative mood, ≤72 chars, no trailing period
- Body: what and why, not how
